          <p>To launch the documentary film All In: The Fight for Democracy, weâ€™re hitting the road to promote voter rights, register voters, and screen the film itself on outdoor pop-up screens for as many people as we can. A fleet of five buses will tour in 10 states, setting up temporary stations in over 50 locations that are most impacted by voter-suppression tactics. </p>
