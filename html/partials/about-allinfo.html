          <p>To launch the documentary film All In: The Fight for Democracy, the #AllInForVoting campaign is hitting the road to safely educate, mobilize and register voters. The film will be shown at socially distanced outdoor pop-up screenings for as many people as we can. A fleet of five buses will tour across 10 states with high levels of voter restrictions, setting up temporary voting action stations in over 50 locations.</p>
